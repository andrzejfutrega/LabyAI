      "Regional compilation was just merged into Accelerate and it massively cuts down compilation time while maintaining ALL the benefits 🚀\n",
      "\n",
      "Torch.compile is one of @PyTorch’s most exciting features for performance optimization. But one pain point has always been its initial compile time, where waiting 10–20+ seconds on first run can be frustrating or even prohibitive 😭\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s where regional compilation comes in ; Instead of compiling the entire model as one big graph, creating a huge optimization search space, we target and compile the repeating submodule (like the transformer block) once and reuse it through the compiler cache 🧠\n",
      "\n",
      "This dramatically reduces compilation overhead while maintaining most of the performance 🚀 At model size >= 8B OR batch size >= 4, inference speedups are the SAME with 5-9x faster compilation, which means better UX for developers and more agility in iterative workflows.\n",
